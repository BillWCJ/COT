Augmented Reality Headset as Portable External Monitor Replacement For Laptops

# Inspiration
While working on my laptop on the go, I found the single small screen to be uncomfortable, unproductive and unergonomic.
At the same time, portable external monitor screens are just as small and a hassle...

I envisioned a wearable head-mount as the perfect solution for having infinite number of portable monitors

# Hardware
